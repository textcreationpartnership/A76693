         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am the foundation, and he that buildeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me ſhal have eternal life; I have mourned for you as one mourneth for her firſt born, &amp; you would not come unto me that you might live; I have knocked and called, and none would hear; therefore will I thunder out my judgements upon this wicked generation which hath not the fear of God; therefore the wicked ſhall ſee it and tremble: horror and terror, and pain ſhall take hold upon them as upon a woman in travel, and many ſhall cry, but there ſhall be none to deliver them; therfore repent whilſt I give you a day, leſt you become as fruitleſs trees which cumbers the ground; for every plant that my heavenly Father hath not planted, will be pluckt up by the roots, and therefore repent whilſt I give you a day, for I gave <hi>Ieſabel</hi> a day, and I gave <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a day, but they would not; therefore mind what I ſhall ſay, and where I do ſpeak be ſtill, and low, and wait in ſilence, and then you ſhall hear a voice ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it,</hi> and if any have any deſire to walk in this way, I will be with them, and guide them, and there ſhall you find ſweet paths, and plentious redemption. Therefore for your ſouls health; for it was for the good of your ſouls that I took upon me the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and became the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, were it not that I loved the world; therefore I would not have you go aſtray as ſheep without a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſcattered up and down upon every Mountain and Valley, and carried away with every wind of doctrine; but now am I a raiſing up my own ſeed which hath been ſo long under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the task-maſter. <hi>Cambridge</hi> thou task-maſter, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thou oppreſſer which opreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Juſt ſeed within thee, in ſetting up thy own righteouſneſs and wiſdom, which ſhall grow as ragged as an old garment that moths hath eat, and I will make thee know that my righteouſneſs endureth from generation to generation, and ſo for ever. And now let hills be removed, and mountains be daſhed to pieces, and the ſtrong hold be levelled; for a day there is coming that will make the keepers of the houſe tremble; woful and terrible will that day be to the wicked: whilſt the ſtrong-man keeps the houſe all is at peace, but when a ſtronger than he cometh, he then muſt be turned out; <hi>I came not to bring peace but war,</hi> ſaith Chriſt Jeſus, and now turn in your eyes from beholding vanity; for that eye looketh from Chriſt, and that nature is accurſed from God, for Chriſt Jeſus is pure, and can behold no vain thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And now I have ſhown you the way that you ſhould walk in, take heed to the light that ſhineth in a dark place: light ſhineth in darkneſs, &amp; the darkneſs comprehendeth it not; therefore repent that the darkneſs may be taken away, and ſo become children of the light, and not children of the night, but children of the day; for they that walk in the day ſtumble not, becauſe they have the light with them: but they that walk in the night ſtumble, becauſe they are in darkneſs; And now let the light ſearch you, for Chriſt Jeſus is now ſearching <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Candles, and not one corner of it muſt go unſearched. Beware of ſeducers that cometh in ſheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves; for ſuch Chriſt Jeſus ſpoke of, that ſhould come in the latter days.
